A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

`SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) FROM empsalary;`

```
   depname  | empno | salary |          avg          
-----------+-------+--------+-----------------------
 develop   |    11 |   5200 | 5020.0000000000000000``

The OVER clause determines exactly how the rows of the query are split up for processing by the window function. 

The PARTITION BY list within OVER specifies dividing the rows into groups, or partitions, that share the same values of the PARTITION BY expression(s).

For each row, the window function is computed across the rows that fall into the same partition as the current row. You
can also control the order in which rows are processed by window functions using ORDER BY within OVER.

#### ROW_NUMBER:
The ROW_NUMBER() is a window function that assigns a sequential integer number to each row in the queryâ€™s result set.
```
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY expr1, expr2,...]
    ORDER BY expr1 [ASC | DESC], expr2,...
)
```

First, the PARTITION BY clause divides the result set returned from the FROM clause into partitions. The PARTITION BY clause is optional. If you omit it, the whole result set is treated as a single partition.
Then, the ORDER BY clause sorts the rows in each partition. Because the ROW_NUMBER() is an order sensitive function, the ORDER BY clause is required.
Finally, each row in each partition is assigned a sequential integer number called a row number.
